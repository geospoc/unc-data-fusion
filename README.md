# Spatiotemporal Fusion for Planetscope(PS) and Mapbox tiles 


#### Objective

Objective is to use PS image to predict Mapbox data to current date. This would help prevent false negatives in the model prediction of Schools/hospitals.


#### Queries/Assumptions: 

- Temporal difference affects fused images and inturn the model predictions. 

- PS(4.77m) & Mapbox Tiles (~0.5m pixel spacing). Course nature of PS doesnâ€™t affect the features in the fused image.
